<h1>Lappy 486 details</h1>

<p>42 lbs. weight or lighter
<p>2 or 5 MB Hard Drive
<p>"Several" Colour Monitor (Likely 256 colours)
<p>5 Min. Battery Life
<p>512k RAM

<p>Wireless Internet Connection

<p>590x360 px screen res. (guess)

<img src="lappyemail.png">

<p>Screen Ratio: 1.67:1 (W:H) or 5:3, as opposed to a normal screen of 1.3:1 (4:3), a high-definition screen of 1.78:1 (16:9), and a widescreen of 1.85:1

<p>An Undelete Feature (As seen in SBCG4AP)

<p>Operating System: In an interview with Strong Bad on The Screen Savers, Strong Bad states that his computer runs on an operating system known as "2S-point-Cynics 5, The Upgrade". The spelling of this was guessed, so it is not completely accurate. 

<p>In addition to the usual DELETED! feature, the Lappy could also flash a "DO OVER!!" screen with an explosion effect, as seen in do over. 

<p>It utilized a more modern email client that included a subject line, a reply panel, and the following easy-access buttons: Reply, Forward, Delete, Save, Computer, and Image. (Delete, Save, Computer, and Image are usually hidden behind Strong Bad's head.) However, all of it would disappear after Strong Bad would clear the screen to continue typing. 

<p>The number of colors present suggest that the Lappy 486 uses at least a VGA display.

<p>Some of the programs Strong Bad has on the Lappy 486, most of which are started by typing the filename only after the prompt:

<ul>
<li>    strongbad_email.exe - (Used in emails 119-201 except for email 142 (secret identity) (see below), email 159 (retirement), which had two emails checked on the Tandy and the Compy, and email 169 (from work) which was checked on the Corpy NT6.)
<li>    run "Edga Jr." (long pants) - filters emails with indents
<li>    run "webcam" (death metal) - initiates live video chat with Larry Palaroncini
<li>    strongbad_email.wad (secret identity) - Strong Bad inexplicably types this to access his email (DOS usually does not recognize WAD files as executables).
<li>    screen_savior.exe (technology) - runs an infinitely repeating 3D Maze screensaver with poor graphics
<li>    Edgar's Baby's Daddy (filename unknown) (candy product) - Filters emails from Homestar Runner
<li>    karatecar.exe (the movies) - an ASCII art movie played on the Lappy's screen
<li>    strongbad3Dtotal.wad (SBCG4AP Advertisement) - A simple 3D game featuring Strong Bad and Homestar.
<li>    CG4AP101.wad (Homestar Ruiner's Wii Channel) - displays the logo for Homestar Ruiner, and flashes up a "PRESS START" notice after a couple of seconds. Presumably also used for Strong Bad to run the game.
<li>    other_gems.exe and more_other_gems.exe (being mean) - displays other emails this email's sender, Nice Dad, has sent.
<li>    CG4AP102.wad (Strong Badia the Free's Wii Channel) - displays the logo for Strong Badia the Free, and flashes up a "PRESS START" notice after a couple of seconds. Presumably also used for Strong Bad to run the game.
<li>    CG4AP103.wad (Baddest of the Bands' Wii Channel) - displays the logo for Baddest of the Bands, and flashes up a "PRESS START" notice after a couple of seconds. Presumably also used for Strong Bad to run the game.
<li>    CG4AP104.wad (Dangeresque 3: The Criminal Projective's Wii Channel) - displays the logo for Dangeresque 3: The Criminal Projective, and flashes up a "PRESS START" notice after a couple of seconds. Presumably also used for Strong Bad to run the game.
<li>    CG4AP105.wad (8-Bit is Enough's Wii Channel) - displays the logo for 8-Bit is Enough, and flashes up a "PRESS START" notice after a couple of seconds. Presumably also used for Strong Bad to run the game.
<li>    Some type of speech synthesizer - As the Lappy speaks to Strong Bad from time to time, it would seem that there must be one installed. 
</ul>
