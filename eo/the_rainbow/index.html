<p>Yes. Global warming and wave(?) is impossible because God promised Noah that there wouldn't be any more floods.</p>

<p>Do not call me "orthohawk" so one won't offend me. My preference is "mrmosier". not using my preferred name is offensive.</p>

<p>So, this God uses the rainbow as a symbol. Really?</p>

<p>Here's the story, Vejktoro. In Genesis, God told Noah that there will be a worldwide flood and he must build a large boat. Many people thought that Noah was crazy, but after that the flood happened and those people died. The only person saved was Noah and his family and many animals (pure and unpure). To make a long story short, after some time the boat landed on Mt. Ararato. Noah, after that, made an altar for God and God made a rainbow as a reminder that he wouldn't destroy the World with a flood.</p>
<p>Pardon me if you've heard this story before. <img src="http://en.lernu.net/grafikajhoj/smileys/ridulo.gif" width=15 height=15> Also, pardon me for the errors</p>
