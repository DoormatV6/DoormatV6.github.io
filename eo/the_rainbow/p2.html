<p>No. Global warming and wave(?) is possible, because god-"scientists" and politicians promise people that that is really happening.

<p>Tempodivalse was clearly sarcastic.</p>
<p>In any case, I don't understand what the author of these strange threads is aiming for.</p>

<p>Yes, he was sarcastic and ridiculed religion, but he did that favorably to his own religion, which I call science: the blind belief in any invention (global warming) by any scientists (and usually by politicians). According to this religion scientists are noble gods. (That isn't a general refusal of science by me.)</p>
<p>I am also sarcastic.</p>

<p>Well, the world is confusing. You have to live with that. It would indeed be boring otherwise, no?

<p>A misunderstanding. If one uses a "star" for evil, that is evil/sin. Recruiting Esperanto is not evil (except for Chris Culver, lol), so.......</p>
